            <p>Milo is a high maintenance, lazy dog who prefer lounging over running. His favorite food to eat is Indian food, and he loves anything with chicken in it. He especially loves chicken, but it msut be marinated and seasoned.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <h2>Maple</h2>
            <img src = "images/maple_santa.JPG" width = "400" alt = "Brown striped tabby wearing a santa hat">

            <p>Maple is a 2 year old tabby cat with brown stripes. She is very playful and friendly but also loves lounging in the sun! Maple is a huge fan of treats - she has even learned how to open doors to steal some extra treats.</p>

            <p>Sometimes Maple has boundless energy. At night, she gets the zoomies after eating her final meal of the day. It usually takes her another hour to settle down before she can take a long nap.</p>
